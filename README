This is a simple Apache Maven site skin that is designed
to match the Juice, Inc. style. To use this skin for your
Maven project site, you will need to add a reference to
this juice-maven-skin artifact in your project's site descriptor. A site
references a skin in the site descriptor using the skin element:

<project name="A Project">
  ...
  <skin>
    <groupId>org.juicekit.skins</groupId>
    <artifactId>juice-maven-skin</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </skin>
  ...
</project>

You can refer to this projects src/site/site.xml for an example.
